[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/47deg/scala-android.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/47deg/scala-android)

Scala API Demos
=============

This repository contains examples of using Scala on Android. The [Macroid](http://macroid.github.io/) library is used in the project to assist in GUI operations.

You can download the project from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fortysevendeg.scala.android)

Compile
======

You can compile this project and contribute improvements. To compile the project:

* Download [Activator](https://typesafe.com/community/core-tools/activator-and-sbt) and install it
* Configure the Android SDK on your computer
* Clone this GitHub project to your computer
* From project root directory run:

```
$ ./activator
```

* Connect your phone and execute:

```
> run
```

You can use your favorite IDE. At 47 Degrees we use IntelliJ with the Scala plugin. If you want to run this project from IntelliJ you only need to import the project.

Add Debug Keys
========

You need to add a `debug.properties` file to the root project with the necessary keys to compile. The content should be:

```
openweather.api.key=***
google.map.key=***
```

Contribute your own examples
===============

If you want to learn *Scala on Android* and you want to share your examples, you can send us a PR with your new feature. 

Follow these steps to create your example:

* Create a new package inside `ui` for your sample
* The package for a feature contains all of the UI information (it's not necessary but you should consider it). This information is:
	* Activities
	* Fragments
	* Adapters
	* Styles: this file replaces the XML Resources. All styles are defined in this file
	* Layouts: this file replaces the XML Resources. All layouts are defined in this file
* Add your activity to `AndroidManifest.xml`
* Create a new node in `activities.json` inside the `asset` directory. The JSON should look like this:

```
  {
    "name": "Name of your example",
    "description": "Description of your example",
    "className": "Path of your activity",
    "minApi": "An integer designating the minimum API Level required ",
    "targetApi": "An integer designating the API Level that the application targets",
    "scalaLevel": "An integer designating the Scala Level of your example [1,2,3]",
    "androidLevel": "An integer designating the Android Level of your example [1,2,3]",
    "user" : {
      "avatar": "Your avatar URL",
      "name": "Your name",
      "twitter": "Your twitter username"
    }
  }
```

```
1 -> Beginner
2 -> Intermediate
3 -> Advanced
```
 
If you are having trouble deciding on an example to contribute here are some ideas:

* Transitions between activities: use the new [Activity Transitions in Material Design](https://developer.android.com/training/material/animations.html#Transitions), similar to *Google Play Music*
* Validate forms with [Validation in ScalaZ](http://eed3si9n.com/learning-scalaz/Validation.html)
